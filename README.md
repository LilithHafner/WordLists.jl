WordLists.jl provides lists of words from various languages (currently English, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish).

```julia-repl
julia> words("English")
257874-element Vector{String}:
 "Aani"
 "Aaron"
 "Aaronic"
 "Aaronical"
 "Aaronite"
 "Aaronitic"
 â‹®
 "zymotize"
 "zymotoxic"
 "zymurgy"
 "zythem"
 "zythum"
```

## Help Wanted

The current set of languages is small and the list of French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese words is incomplete. If you have access to a higher quality list of French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese words or words from a different language, please open a pull request or issue.
